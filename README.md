A Free Anti Spoofing / Liveliness Detector is a crucial component within a Face Recognition System designed to distinguish 
between real human faces and fake representations, such as photographs or videos. By employing 
various techniques, such as analyzing facial movements, texture, depth, or requiring user interaction, a 
Liveliness Detector ensures the authenticity of the face being presented for recognition. This safeguard 
helps prevent unauthorized access or fraudulent activities, enhancing the security and reliability of face 
recognition systems in various applications, including access control, identity verification, and financial 
transactions.
